In Lesson 7 assignment, I am gained practical experience in building a web application using Node.js and Express, focusing on handling file uploads and processing data. Specifically, I learned how to adapt the server-side code to parse JSON files instead of CSV files. This experience provided insights into server-side development, file handling, and data processing, enhancing your overall understanding of web development tools and practices.
