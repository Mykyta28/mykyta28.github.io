    I have learned how to work with Microsoft Excel and how to graphically represent the ratio of time with tasks and<br>
    also different stages of creating projects. This type of Gratt chart will help you use time more efficiently in the future.<br>
    And it's also convenient that I can use different ways of displaying my data for a deeper understanding of the original data.<br>
