    <h2>Internet Reference Models</h2>
    <p>
      I choose this topic because I was interesting what is <b>OSI model</b> and <b>TPC/IP</b> and how it works.<br>
      I have heard about TPC/IP bunch of times but never deeply have learned about, now I found out<br>
      what is TCP and UDP in what cases they are useful and why. And what is OSI who has 7 layers<br>
      what kind of layers is that and what they are need for.<br><br>
      
      <b>I have learned</b> What is:<br>
      <b>TCP/IP</b> - this is det of network protocols which has 4 levels: <b>Application</b>, <b>Transport</b><br>
      <b>Internet</b> and <b>Host to network</b>.<br>
      
      <b>Application</b> responsible for interaction network and user this level allows user apps have an access to<br> 
      network services such as database query handler or access to files.<br>
      The functions such as LOGIN or password checking are also performed by the application layer. HTTP, POP3, SMTP<br>
      
      <b>Transport</b> - design for transport data, he divide blocks of data then transport them then assemble them back when they arrived.<br>
      TCP, UDP, SCTP.<br>
      
      <b>Internet</b> - design for defined data transport pave, responsible for quick and correct pass. (network device - router),<br>
      
      <b>Host to network</b> - This is the lowest layer in TCP/IP model. The host has to connect to network using some protocol<br>
      so that it can send IP packets over it. This protocol varies from host to host and network to network.<br>
      Protocol example is Ethernet.<br>
     
      <b>OSI Model</b> - this model completely describe how networking devices works<br>
      and this is model you must know so that to understand how computers network operate.<br><br>
      
      <b>TCP</b> - this the most basic protocol who operating in transfer data level<br>
      this protocol need for transfer data in network. <b>TCP</b> (transfer control protocol) responsible for<br>
      correct transmission and receipt responds from receiver. <b>TCP</b> has one minus, speed of working, due to<br>
      the fact that protocol have responsibilities of correct transmission and he need to connect to the host to exchange data<br>
      he loosing his speed an opposed to <b>UDP<b/> - he do not need to make connection to exchange data, therefore he works faster.<br>
      who do not have any responsibilities and just sending the data as quick as possible. Accordingly <b>UDP</b> can be using<br>
      in phone calls or video calls and <b>TCP</b> can be using where we need to receive important, ordered data.
      
      I have dove actions such as searching info outside of homework materials and watched additional videos.<br>
      I think, I can use that in a future if I'll work in that IT field, for now I can just keep this info in mind to be skilled programmer.
    </p>
     <h2>Ipconfig</h2>
    <p>
     <b>Ipconfig</b> - this is command to manage network interfaces and displays and updates all current settings <b>TCP/IP</b>.<br>
     <b>Ipconfig</b> allows tou to see or change settings network PC interfaces. Interface using different protocols such as Ethernet<br>
     IP, TCP, UDP, DHCP, DNS and ect). Also we can find IP address of your PC, subnet mask where this PC located and gateway (local ip address on router).<br>
    
     <b>I have learned</b> how ipconfig works, what this comment shows you and what you can find useful for you.<br>
     Also you can find <b>LAN</b> (local area network) - usually cover the small zone.<br> 
     Also there is <b>VLAN</b> (virtual lacal area network - by which you can create several <b>VLAN</b> on one router pchycal port.<br>
     There is exist <b>WAN</b> (wide area network) - you an find that port on your router, this port is from which the cable comes to your provider.<br>
     By the way, speed of transporting data in <b>LAN</b> much faster then <b>WAN.</b>
      
      I have dove actions such as:<br>
      Oppening <b>cmd</b> -> typed <b>ipconfig</b> - press <b>enter</b> and it's displyed me avalible adapters<br>
      and IP settings.<br>
      
      Oppening <b>cmd</b> -> typed <b>ipconfig /all</b> - press <b>enter</b> and it's displyed me avalible adapters and<br>
      DHCP configuration information and all IP settings.<br>
      My PC shows me:<br>
      <b>Lease Obtained. . . . . . . . . . : Sunday, February 26, 2023 11:21:38 AM</b>
      <b>Lease Expires . . . . . . . . . . : Monday, February 27, 2023 2:25:23 AM</b>
      
      Oppening <b>cmd</b> -> typed <b>ipconfig/displaydns</b> - press <b>enter</b> and it's shows me the contents of the DNS resolver cache.<br>
      
      Oppening <b>cmd</b> -> typed <b>ipconfig /flushdns</b> - press <b>enter</b> and it's shows me successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache.<br>
      
      Again, I think I can use that if I'll work in that IT field, for now I can just keep this info in mind to be skilled programmer.<br>
