    <h3>Validate your web page</h3>
    <p>
      I have read W3C: Validating your HTML article about how to debug your code and how to find the error in your code<br>
      but some times it's hard to find what went wrong becaude browser will display the page, but not quite what you wanted<br>
      at this level, you can solve the problem by knowing how this or that element on the page works and interact with each other.
