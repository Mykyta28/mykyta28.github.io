    Internet Services include everything related to the work on the internet, it is depend on your interest, there is so many apps

    After studying this material, I learned that the TELNET is a network protocol for implementing a text terminal interface over a network
    (in its modern form, using TCP transport). The name "telnet" is also used by some utilities that implement the client side of the protocol.
    Also I've learned that video conferencing or video teleconferencing can be point to point and multi-point and what is it FTP (file transfer protocol)
    Gopher (is a client/server directory system launched in 1991. It allowed people to quickly view resources on the Internet)
    and Archie (information system with the most efficient search system)
    I can use a lot of services for person purpose and commercial purpose, but I can't tell right now  what exactly I will use in the feature
    it's depend on my occasion.

  <h3>Skype</h3>
  <p>
    Skype - the program which allows to you communicate with each other. That program might be use for commercial or non-commercial use.
    There can call up as 2 people and whole group of people.<br>
    I can use Skype to communicate with my relatives who are in another country, see them on playback and play as live. Also used for targeted purposes
    for my future profession in programming, for contacting customers, discussing the design of the site (using the skype interface-share screen)
  </p>

    After studying this material, I learned that the Skype program can be used on different devices and different platforms:
    IOS, Android, Mac and Online in the any browser. Visually, these applications are different.
    Also, now I know how to restore access to my account if I forgot my username or password.
