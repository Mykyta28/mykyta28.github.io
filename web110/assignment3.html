  <h1>Internet Fundamentals/Search Engines</h1>
  <p> I have learned ho to use different typed of Web sites search engines effectively by usinf Google Chrome.
    For my search I was practicing with tools as OR, AND, site:, -, and "". Also for better search you can use the information that
    has been located, that is can give you the idea how to reformulate your queations to get the right answer of your topics.
    Also you can you different browsers to see what browser give you the best answer on your quation.
    You have to remember the shorter will and accurate will be your quation the more likely you will get correct answer.
    For my futere searching I am going to use this tools to make it easier to find info in the internet

    <h1>Internet Fundamentals/HTML</h1>
  </p>
    In this section I have lerned that HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications,
    wich helps you to build web pages with CCS and Javascrpt. Also that Web browsers receive HTML documents from
    a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
    HTML tags most commonly come in pairs, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired.
    The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag. They may also be called opening tags and closing tags.
    There is A lot of different tags in HTML5 but in my opinion, you do not hane to know every tag, the most important what you need to
    know is how to use them, how to find the right tag and the interaction structure between them. 
    Of course I will use HTML5 at my projects this is base what you have to lern how to use it, but in new word I could not do web programming
    with just using HTML.
