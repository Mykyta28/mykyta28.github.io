    SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical<br>
    and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.<br>
    And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
    I have read all articles and have done all quizzes. I have learned how to use all sql queries to retrieve, update and delete certain elements from database.
