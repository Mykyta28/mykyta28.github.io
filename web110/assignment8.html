  <h2>GCFLearnFree: Internet Safety</h2>
  <p>
     I had chosen this topic because I was interested how I can protect my data. Although I know a lot of way how I should protect data<br>
     and know some trick how not to get caught by viruses, malware and else, but anyways they've got me couple time by phishing just because of<br>
     inattentive and rush.<br><br>
    
     I repeated what I already knew superficially and went a litter deeper into the essence. I have read additional information about security<br>
     and safety. in nowadays if you will be aware what are the types of info theft and use the 3 basic rules of safety such as: 1)do not click<br>
     on suspicious links. 2) check link address. 3) use the different passwords (recommendations: use digits, letters, Uppercase, Lowercase, symbols, and min 8 chars).
     <br> And you will be okay. And how to set up the firewall to protect incoming data stream.<br><br>
    
     Also, I have fulfilled "Google safe browsing diagnostic", just checking how it works.<br>
     I have learned that never provide you data, following links or do shopping online without making sure that this is a safe website.<br>
     and always use two factor authentication anywhere you can apply it. Also becareful with using wifi, unless it's your home wifi<br>
     and make sure your sosial media settings is secure.
    
     In my future I can apply these methods of protections for my computer where are I'm gonna create my websites and storage my data. <br>
     Also I can protect the local network of several computers.<br> The main thing no matter how you are protected, remember, always do backup your data<br>
     everything can be hacked and person may not notice something or neglect safety due to fatigue and rush.<hr><br><br>

  <p>
      I have review browser options and set it up for myself<br>
      1) I checked my browser version, I have version 110.0.5481.96.<br>
      2) I checked my add-ons, everything is up to date.<br>
      3) I cleared cache and cookies.<br>
      4) I checked autofill data, and clear everything I do not neet to save.<br>
      5) I visited  https://en.wikiversity.org website and found his valid certification.<br>
      6) I used incognito browsing to visit websites for not to leave traces in browser history.<br><br>
      
      In the future I can apply this knowledge for my work and personal Google accounts for better managing my browser data.
