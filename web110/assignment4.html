      I've lerned from this section how e-mail actually work, what id it SMTP - which was created in 1982, then they are found problem
       with security and in 2008 developed ESMTP (ExtentionSimple Mail Transfer Protocol), now you need to autorizedto e-mail and before not.
      Also how do resever get E-mail, they are using IMAP or POP3 for it, differents between them is POP3 remove all e-mails reseved by user
      from the storege and IMAP working directly with storege and e-mails do not remove from the storege. Also in nowadays they are using domains
      and the system of e-mails interacts with DNS so that you can know mail serves adress, for this there is MX (mail eXchange) which containts 
      addresses of servers receiving e-mail for this domain.

      I've lerned from this section how to make sing pattern, it's makes it easier to send e-mails.
      Also I found out what is the CC and BCC. CC - stands for (carbon copy), when you put an email
      address in the CC (carbon copy) field it means that a copy of the email
      you are sending will also be sent to that address.
      BCC - stands for (blind carbon copy), when you put an email address in the BCC or (blind carbon copy)
      field it means that a copy of the email you are sending will also be sent to that address,
      but no one receiving the email will be able to see the address in the BCC field.
