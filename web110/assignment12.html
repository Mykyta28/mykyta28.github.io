  <h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
  <p>
    Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, in my own words - this is place where anybody can be anyone<br>
    place where it does not matter if you have physical disabilities, situational disabilities and you can go anywhere<br.
    and see everything, place where people interact with each others and get the information they need. in nowadays<br>
    Internet is a sours of income, entertainment, education and communication.<br>
    Web accessibility is the practice of making websites usable for all visitors<br>
    including those with disabilities, impairments, and limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
      I have learned that exist many different software that help people with certain disabilities<br>
      such as deaf, blind and even for people with limited movements, that is what voice control is for.
  </p>
  <p>
      In my future I can help people to find certain software that will help them read, listen that information what they need<br>
      and make for them comfortable to use Internet.

    <h2>W3C Markup Validation Service</h2>
    <p>
        The Markup Validator is a free service by W3C that helps check the validity of Web documents.<br>
        Most Web documents are written using markup languages, such as HTML or XHTML.<br>
        These languages are defined by technical specifications, which usually include a machine-readable formal grammar (and vocabulary).
    </p>
    <p>
        I've learned why Validate a Site on W3C? W3C validation is the process of checking a website's code<br>
        to determine if it follows the formatting standards. If you fail to validate your website's pages based on W3C standards<br>
        your website will most likely suffer from errors or poor traffic owing to poor formatting and readability.
        I have used this validator service for check my code, I like this service<br>
        it helps me to remember important things when writing code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my future I can use this validator to check my code because then I will do big projects<br>
        and it will be difficult notice everything and you will need to use this validator to write clear code.
