  <h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
  <p>
    Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, in my own words - this is place where anybody can be anyone<br>
    place where it does not matter if you have physical disabilities, situational disabilities and you can go anywhere<br.
    and see everything, place where people interact with each others and get the information they need. in nowadays<br>
    Internet is a sours of income, entertainment, education and communication.
  </p>
  <p>
      I have learned that exist many different software that help people with certain disabilities<br>
      such as deaf, blind and even for people with limited movements, that is what voice control is for.
  </p>
  <p>
      In my future I can help people to find certain software that will help them read, listen that information what they need<br>
      and make for them comfortable to use Internet.
