  <h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
  <p>
    Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, in my own words - this is place where anybody can be anyone<br>
    plece where it does not matter if you have physical disabilities, situational disabilities and you can go anywhere<br.
    and see everything, place where people interact with each others and get the information they need. in nowadays<br>
    Internet is a sourse of income, entertainment, education and communication.
