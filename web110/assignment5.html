    <h1>Sosial Media<h1>
      <p>
        Social Media - it's specific platform to interaction between people. 
        Nowadays SM became the whole world for people, they can buy, sell, study, teach, communicate, get rest, have fun, travel and much more.
        Right now people have so much opportunities using WWW, but it was not always so. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1991 year was came out WEB 1.0 by Tim Berners-Lee,
        WEB 1.0 has a little choice of interaction with the website (I'd say webpage) which was considered as a "read only" webpages,
        it was statistic websites you could download pictures, mp3 files or follow links, you could not register, create account, leave comment and etc. 
        in another words users could not interact with website except owners, website data was kept on the server in file systems and websites 
        were issued in the form in which they were originally and that is forced owners to re-implement the site due to the addition of new info,
        and there was pointed out required resolution to display the info correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then in 2005 came out new version WEB 2.0, it was based on idea "internet as a platform", there is much more interactivity thanks to JS and CSS3.
        Appeared platforms such as YouTube, FaceBook and Wikipedia, so the user could have create a post (photo, pictures and etc.)
        create an account, leave the comment. WEB 2.0 is centralized system this is mean all your data is recorded and store on servers owned by 
        companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple and etc., so your data is not yours :), you could check this by posting "wrong info" about government 
        on your FaceBook or Twitter webpage or by posting naked pics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then in 2014 came out WEB 3.0, it is decentralized system. The fist difference from WEB 2.0 you are the sole owner of your data, nobody can block
        or delete your data or your account (in theory:) )
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays we have a lot of social platforms to use, they are design for different purpose, each of them tries keep users at home provide them the 
        information they are interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cand use the WEB 2.0 - 3.0 by opening the browser console and see the code and how elements interact with each other, it is help me out
        when I learn how to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done things like opening the browser console and download the pics or videos or music, change animations and another data on website.
