    <h1> Blog Basics</h1>
      <p>
          <b>Blog</b> is - online journal where an individual share their life in any social media.
          <br>
          I chose the topic of the blog because I myself follow many of them on Instagram. 
          Now I know that most bloggers can make money by advertising products or services in stories or posts, which is very important now all over the world. 
          Bloggers relate to many people with their advice and life experience of broadcasting it in society. I also found out that the majority of bloggers 
          (31%) are between the ages of 25 and 34.
          <br>
          Studying this topic will help me find bloggers on the other hand, that these are people who are not "playing for the camera",
          who are absolutely open, that they are ready to spread their lives to the whole society, which inspires me and helps to distribute beyond
          their comfort, a certain an example for me that one should not be afraid to just take and try.

      <h1>Facebook</h1>
       <p>
           <b>Facebook</b> is - one of the social media is the most popular in the world. Thereyou can share your photo, video, thoughts
           communicate with people and create your own blog.
           <br>
           I chose the Facebook theme since I don't use it and I wanted to learn more about it. 
           I knew that Facebook is similar to other social networks that I use, but this social network has privacy tools,
           since I don’t like to show my life, also a very interesting feature that I didn’t know is called “status update”, for
           example, using instagram I don’t knew about it.
           <br>
           This information helped me find out that when I go to any site on the Internet, when registering, I no longer need 
           to register, I can simply log in with my Facebook account and get access, share information through other sites on Facebook,
           personalize the experience, make social plugins.
