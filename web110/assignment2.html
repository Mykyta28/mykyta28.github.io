  <h2>Safari</h2>
    <p>
      I usin Safari because i using Apple producs, although I am not really like using Safari that browser is very fast,
      and does not spend a lot of resources compared to the same Google Chrome. Also Safari has a really good data security which the 
      Google Chrome cannot boast of.
