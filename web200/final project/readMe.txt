Hello Michael!
I'm Mykyta Semenii.
I have created "SimpleBank" app, it is very simple bank :) (maybe I'll continue developing this app but with react help :)) )

My app has a functionality such as:

1) Log in to the app
2) Sign up to the app
3) View the profile
4) View information about user
5) Sort transactions in unidirectional order
5) Transfer the money to another user
6) Take a loan from the bank
7) Close the account 

Everithing you do, you can do using user initials (Cecil Ireland = "ci").

Please, do not judje so hurd, yes I know it's kind of shitty :)) code from pro/comercial side. I just did not know how to make 1 page app using JS
in another way... Sorry.

Thank you!
